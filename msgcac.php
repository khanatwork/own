						It is my pleasure to welcome you to Sidney Elementary School. The
						teachers and staff join me in saying we are happy to have you as part of our
						school family. We know this will be a successful and satisfying year for you.
						One of our biggest goals for the year is to help your child feel successful and
						achieve academic excellence. By working together as parents and
						educators, we can build a foundation or life long learning.
						The Sidney Elementary Student Planner was designed to assist your child
						in organizing his/her daily, weekly and long-term assignments. We hope
						this planner will improve your child’s organizational skills. In addition, we
						feel that the planner will serve as a communication tool for teachers and
						parents. At Sidney Elementary we take pride in our relationships with
						parents, and see you as a partner in the important job of educating the
						children of this community.
						We welcome your participation and support during the school year. We
						look forward to celebrating with you the achievements of our students.<br>
						Sincerely,</p>
